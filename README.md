# Weather API Application  
Application of a Weather API using Python.

Used [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)'s free API to retrieve weather details and print them in both the terminal and a text file.  
If no text file is found in the current working directory/folder, a new text file will be formed. If one already exists, data will be appended to it.  

This code was written in a a Linux Machine.

Many thanks to [ShapeAI](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTUvDLTW9meuDXWcbmISPdA) and [this guy](https://github.com/harshakshit) for the help.
